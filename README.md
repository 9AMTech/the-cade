## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Docker, Tailwind, Java, Springboot, JUnit, MS Azure

The Cade is my idea of creating a simplistic and easy to use CRUD for a fictional company. The design was extremely archaic and bare bones before I got to it- rows were horribly spaced, a disturbing lack of any accents, no navbar. It was a mess! I opted to go with a simplistic font, healthy amounts of padding between elements and clean looking toast messages for notifications.
